You are authoring text documents about music, maybe you're a musicologist, teacher, or composer?
You are preparing such documents for publication and have always missed the ability to print sentences like this one?

\begin{quote}
In m.\,24 the \decrescHairpin{} lasts from the 2\superscript{nd} \halfNote{} to the \lilyDynamics{sf} on the 11\superscript{th} \semiquaverDown[raise=-.5].
\end{quote}

With the new package \lilyglyphs{} you can easily insert the notational elements of the LilyPond%
\footnote{\url{http://www.lilypond.org}}
engraving software in your text documents.
Accidentals like \flat{} or \sharp, but also articulation scripts (\hspace{.65ex}\fermata{}) and time signatures such as \lilyTimeCHalf{} or \lilyTimeSignature{5\,+\,7}{8} are readily available.
But you can also insert arbitrary notational constructs like this mockup example \lilyFancyExample{} into your text or even make scanned images available as “characters”.
This package may greatly extend your typographical options when authoring or typesetting critical reports, analytical texts or teaching/exam material.

One thing that sets \lilyglyphs{} apart from other solutions I had investigated is that one isn't restricted to a set of predefined symbols but is able to print \emph{any notation} that can be realized with LilyPond. 

\footnotesize
The other nice thing is that the glyphs \halfNoteRest{} scale well with the surrounding font size, 
\large making it easy \halfNoteRest{} to incorporate them into continuous text.
\normalsize By default the glyphs scale automatically but they can also be scaled \clefF[scale=.4] manually, either individually or document-wise \clefG[scale=1.5,raise=-3.1].

\medskip
Sounds too good to be true? Well, there’s one catch to it: \lilyglyphs{} is a \LaTeX{}%
\footnote{\url{http://www.latex-project.org}}
package, so you may have to consider a change in mind-set. 
But if the above examples whet your appetite and match your professional needs you should really consider giving it a serious try -- it's all Free Software anyway.
